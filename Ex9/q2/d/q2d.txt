Winston:
- We convert the message in bytes.
- We calculate the number of messages that we need to send.
- We create the ith packet with the required attributes, where the seq is the index i, andhthe ack is the number of packets that calculated as metioned above. 
- The reserved 3 bits is the last 3 bits of the global msg_int 
- We shift right the msg_int 3 times (so we will take the next 3 bits in the next time).
- We send the packets using sr function.


Julia:

- filter = "lo" to listen to local host.
- prn = stealth. this function checks if the sprot is the SRC_PORT and if the flags are 'SA'. 
- We extract the total message number from the ack field, the message index from the seq field, and the 3-bit message. 
- We update the global variable.
- stop_filter - Stop condition for the sniffing.

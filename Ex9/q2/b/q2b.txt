Winston: 
- Adds padding by using PKCS7 on 128 bits.
- Encrypts the padded data by using AES with a random IV and the KEY.
- Sending the IV at the begining of the message and than the encrypted padded data.

Julia:
- Extracts the IV which is not encrypted and its at the first 16 bytes.
- Uses the KEY and the IV  to decrypt the rest of the payload. 
- Uses the last byte to remove the padding.

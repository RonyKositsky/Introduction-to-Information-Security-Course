The code compares the first n chars of the string, where 'n' is the index of the first ':', or the index where the username should end. 

'n' can be determined by the user that gives the input, so we can just put an empty string and always return true.

the same problem exists also in the password validation mechanism. 
We return the string "::echo hacked" so it contains 2 times ":" so the credentials are valid.

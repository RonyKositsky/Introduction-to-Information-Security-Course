We use the fact that it takes time until the program opens the file until the validation actually happens.
Until it happens, we change the file to the file with the command we desire. This way we are opening the file and still can run our code.

We open a new file called and write to it the legal content.
We create a child process which will use run program. The parent waits, and then changes the file to the command we want.

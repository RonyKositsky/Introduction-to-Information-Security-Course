I followed the algorithm shown in class and the homework instruction.
First, let's do some math:
- We can see that the first ASCII byte in address 0xbfffdfa9.
- It begins in the offset of 71 bytes, we can calculate it because I found out the epi register value is 0x4e4e4e
  which is the letter 'N'(we inserted it in the first section).
- So we want to inject the start of the program and set epi to 0xbfffdfa9.
- We load the assembly, writing nop silde until byte 67 and the injecting new return address.

Second, our assembly is pretty simple(code documentation inside the code).
It follows the algorithm we saw with Barak. We are preparing the the command and calling system call.

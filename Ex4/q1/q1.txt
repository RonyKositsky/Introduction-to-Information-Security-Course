I'm calling the sudo password with my password to exploit the vulnerability.
Lets break the program:
- First, our password length is 10 as desired.
- Now, we can dive to the ida code. The stack is built in this order:
	* auth variable.
	* buff array.
	* hash array.
- We concatenating the array with our password and then checking the hash.
- If we will write the right password we will set auth variable to 1(right on top of the buffer).
- When we will put '\' at the end it will not count its length but will include it in the string.
- In this way we overcome the problem and use the vulnerability.

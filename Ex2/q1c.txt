I used this link for my idea https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/30209/developing-algorithm-for-detecting-plain-text-via-frequency-analysis.

The idea is to conduct chi squared test against the message we recieved.
1. We define the probabilities of each letter in the english language.
2. We are counting the number of instances of letters we recieved.
3. We calculate the chi squared value and return it.

This way we can estimate how "close" we are to real word.

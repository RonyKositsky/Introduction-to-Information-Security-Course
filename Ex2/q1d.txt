The brute force approach will iterate all possible keys in length n.
We will have n^256 options which we will iterate over and return the result.
This is the procedure:
1. Create all possible keys.
2. Decrypt it using the keys. 
3. Calculte its score using the function from last section.
4. Return the highest score.

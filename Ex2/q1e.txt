The difference between the two sections is that we will iterate over n*256 except exponential number of keys.
We will take only the relevant bytes from the cipher for each key byte. Then we will calculate the maxinum score for 
each byte and append it to our byte array.
In the end we will return the cyphered text with our found key.

We will use the same sequence, but in differen approach.
First, the .c file is the same as before. We define the same global variables.

Secondly, we will find the relevant addresses.
To find the GOT address we will use the command from recitation 5 objdump -D ./antivirus -M intel --section=.plt to find 
the address of check_if_virus@plt.
We will use alternative address to switch between them - is_directory function. We will find it with the gdb + break point
as we used it in the last section. Now, we will can to swtich between them.

Lastly, we will implement exaxtly the same code as before, but now we are switching the GOT address. When the antivirus
will check the malware, it will actually will check if it a directory, therefore will not find the virus.

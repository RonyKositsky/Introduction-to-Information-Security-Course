First we implement the ptrace code and preparing the injection of our code as instructed in the instructions.
We define 3 global variable, and give them default ASCII values so we will be able to find them and replace them easily.

In the python file we executing it by reading the binary compiled file, and then finding our sequence and replacing the relevent data we want to inject in the desired place.
We can find it easily because this is the way we defined the global variable. We inject assembly code that returns always 0.

To find the CHECK_IF_VIRUS_CODE I used gdb:
1. add break point on main.
2. run it.
3. print check_if_virus.

We will use this method in the next sections as well.

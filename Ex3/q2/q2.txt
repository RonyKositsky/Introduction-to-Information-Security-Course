I followed the suggested sequence.
First, I implemented the 2 assembly files in the dead zones. The first one in the small one, and the second in the large one.

- The first dead zone jumps to the second one.
- The second one checking whether we got '#!' at the start.
- If so, we are calling _system address.
- If not, we return to our main function.

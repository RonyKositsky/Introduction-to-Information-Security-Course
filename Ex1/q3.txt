The code concatenating 2 strings. We recieve pointers to the start of the chars arrays.
We know that string ends with 0. 
- At the start of the run we enter 0 to EDX.
- We iterate over the first array until we encounter 0. It represents the end of the string.
- Now, we start copying the second string to the end of the first one.
- We continue the loop until we hit 0 againg and that represents the end of the code.

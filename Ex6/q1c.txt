Now, we will update our message:
- Fill the buffer with 135 'A'.
- System syscall address we found with the gdb.
- Exit syscall address we found with the gdb.
- The arguments with address to '/bin/sh' string in the file.
- Exit code.

We can see that the input arguments is two above the function call so our stack will behave as desired.
